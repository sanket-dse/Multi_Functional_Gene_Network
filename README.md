# Multi_Functional_Gene_Network
A project where I try to reproduce the work done by the authors of a research paper on synthetic gene networks. The authors of this paper tried to provide a theoretical framework for a synthetic gene network which would act as a frequency multiplier, oscillator and a switch- a *multifunctional gene network*. 
The network consisited of 4 transcriptional repressors, 6 promoters and an input which would act as transcriptional promoter.
